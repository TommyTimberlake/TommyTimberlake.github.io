            <h3> About Me: </h3>
            <article class="content">
                <p>My name is Aidan Young-Sgoutas. I am a student attending the <em> University of Colorado Boulder </em> the Spring of 2023. I am pursuing a major in Media Production with a minor in Creative Technology Design. I have been involved with radio and television news media since I was a junior in high school, and have cultivated my skills as technical director, reporter, producer, editor, and audio engineer to become executive producer of CU Boulder's sports news broadcast team. Among other achievements I have acted as technical director for the Grusin School of Music, SkoBuffs Sports, and am currently hosting a DJ spot at Boulder's Radio 1190. Lately I have been focused on expanding this skill set into the virtual world by fusing performative media with the VR and AR realm.</p>
                <p>I am from Greece and am well-traveled around the world. I am a violist and once upon a time was second chair in the state. In my freetime I love the outdoors and going out with friends. I am currently training to motorbike through SE Asia after I graduate from school. I am a huge music fan, but also enjoy movies. My favorite film is L'Avventura because I'm a pretentious douchebag, and some of my favorite artists are Beach House, Sonic Youth, Sleigh Bells, Black Flag, Bj√∂rk, and Queens of the Stone Age.</p>

          <h3> My Story </h3>
          <p> I have been a strong arts-leaning individual my entire life. I was an active member of the theater department all throughout middle school and high school, both in performing and backstage production capacities. I grew a fond love of the viola since the First Grade, becoming section leader of the All County Orchestra in 2018, associate principle for the All State Philharmonic Orchestra in 2018, fifth chair in the 2019 All State Symphony Orchestra, as well as the section leader for my high school pit orchestra three years in a row.</p>
          <p> I was born into a family of engineers. My father was born into the construction business and eventually became a computer software engineer. Having this background, I have always attempted to find a merging of both the technical and creative realms. The modern world is a burgeoning hub of possibilities on this front. Personally, I have explored the technical side of multimedia performative arts, video art including film as well as short-form television, as well as radio and podcast development. This focus has included content ranging from scripted narrative to field reporting to experimental dance to live concert production. </p> 
          <p> I am currently seeking to take my experience of technical director, news production and radio music curation into the virtual realm. </p>
          <p> In my personal life I enjoy being outdoors. I am an avid skier, hiker, camper, mountain biker, and a huge fan of basketball. I also have a great love of travel and venturing outside of my comfort zone, participating in projects that have taken me as far as Japan. </p>
