            <h3> About Me: </h3>
            <article class="content">
                <p>Just before this semester over the summer I created a website to house all of my accomplishments for employment. It was a very jank rushjob that was just intended to be a loose reference for employers. I used an online website creation service, but I would have liked to design my own website from the ground up. What I plan to do this year is learn how to code my own website, and by the end of this class have developed at least a proto version of a professional website to house my accomplishments that I can send to employers.</p>
                <p>I am a senior at <em>University of Colorado Boulder</em> majoring in media production and technology engineering. I work for the local sports broadcasting network, as well as have my own radio show at the local KVCU station. I am from Greece and am well-traveled around the world. I am a violist and once upon a time was second chair in the state. In my freetime I love the outdoors and going out with friends. I am currently training to motorbike through SE Asia after I graduate from school. I am a huge music fan, but also enjoy movies. My favorite film is L'Avventura because I'm a pretentious douchebag, and some of my favorite artists are Beach House, Sonic Youth, Sleigh Bells, Black Flag, Bj√∂rk, and Queens of the Stone Age.</p>

          <h3> My Story </h3>
          <p> I have been a strong arts-leaning individual my entire life. I was an active member of the theater department all throughout middle school and high school, both in performing and backstage production capacities. I grew a fond love of the viola since the First Grade, becoming section leader of the All County Orchestra in 2018, associate principle for the All State Philharmonic Orchestra in 2018, fifth chair in the 2019 All State Symphony Orchestra, as well as the section leader for my high school pit orchestra three years in a row.</p>
          <p> I was born into a family of engineers. My father was born into the construction business and eventually became a computer software engineer. Having this background, I have always attempted to find a merging of both the technical and creative realms. The modern world is a burgeoning hub of possibilities on this front. Personally, I have explored the technical side of multimedia performative arts, video art including film as well as short-form television, as well as radio and podcast development. This focus has included content ranging from scripted narrative to field reporting to experimental dance to live concert production. </p> 
          <p> I am currently seeking to take my experience of technical director, news production and radio music curation into the virtual realm. </p>
          <p> In my personal life I enjoy being outdoors. I am an avid skier, hiker, camper, mountain biker, and a huge fan of basketball. I also have a great love of travel and venturing outside of my comfort zone, participating in projects that have taken me as far as Japan. </p>
