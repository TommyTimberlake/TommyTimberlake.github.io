        <p>Just before this semester over the summer I created a website to house all of my accomplishments for employment. It was a very jank rushjob that was just intended to be a loose reference for employers. I used an online website creation service, but I would have liked to design my own website from the ground up. What I plan to do this year is learn how to code my own website, and by the end of this class have developed at least a proto version of a professional website to house my accomplishments that I can send to employers.</p>
        <p>I am a senior at University of Colorado Boulder majoring in media production and technology engineering. I work for the local sports broadcasting network, as well as have my own radio show at the local KVCU station. I am from Greece and am well-traveled around the world. I am a violist and once upon a time was second chair in the state. In my freetime I love the outdoors and going out with friends. I am currently training to motorbike through SE Asia after I graduate from school. I am a huge music fan, but also enjoy movies. My favorite film is L'Avventura because I'm a pretentious douchebag, and some of my favorite artists are Beach House, Sonic Youth, Sleigh Bells, Black Flag, Bj√∂rk, and Queens of the Stone Age.</p>
