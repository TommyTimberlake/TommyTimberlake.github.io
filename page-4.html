    <h3>Broadcast Work</h3>
    <div class = "broadcast-content">
        <p> Sko Buffs Sports is a sports broadcasting channel that I was a part of for four years. The channel covers everything sports related to the University of Colorado Boulder. The channel produces weekly live news broadcasts, smaller sports packages, interviews, highlights, livestreams of hockey games. We reported on games, wrote articles, went to press conferences, and had our own camera crew.</p>
        <p> In 2020 I joined the organization and wrote readers, produced graphics, and managed the media player for the live broadcasts. The next year during the coronavirus I took on the role of Techincal Director. In the fall of 2021 I became associate producer of the channel, as well as live show director. In 2022 I was promoted to Executive Producer of the channel, its brand, and all of its content.</p>
        <p> During my time with SBS the channel grew. We introduced a weekly-produced podcast, our channel covered livestreams for the WCHL and ACHA. <p>
