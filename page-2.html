            <p> Here is a reel of my experience in broadcast media </p>
            <p> This page is meant to show some of the other creative projects I have done over the years. These are not work-related, but are meant to highlight some of the skills and projects I have created over the years. Below are some design pieces I created using Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and 3D Modelling software.</p>
            <p>The next section highlights some of my photography experience. Following this is some of my VR and AR works, and other videos and projects I have worked on over the years.</p>
